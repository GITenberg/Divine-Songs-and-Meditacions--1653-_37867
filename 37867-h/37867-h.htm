<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In 1815, the library of Thomas Park, which had already passed
from Park to Thomas Hill to Longman, was sold. In the catalog of
that collection, a volume of devotional and autobiographical verse
written by one Anne Collins, <i>Divine Songs and Meditacions</i> (1653),
was described as &ldquo;so rare as to be probably unique.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fd_1">[1]</a> That same
year, Longman and his associates published an anthology of &ldquo;Old
Books in English Literature, Revived,&rdquo; edited by Sir Egerton Brydges
and entitled <i>Restituta</i>. Brydges, who acknowledged the help of
Park in editing the four volume work,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fd_2">[2]</a> reprinted long passages from
the <i>Songs and Meditacions</i>. By mid-century, the book had passed
through the possession of James Midgeley, Sir Mark Masterman Sykes,
Thomas Thorpe,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fd_3">[3]</a> and Richard Heber. In 1878, Alexander Dyce reprinted
all but the last stanza of &ldquo;Another Song exciting to spirituall
Mirth,&rdquo; and some twenty years later, S. Austin Allibone included
reference to Anne Collins in his <i>Critical Dictionary of English Literature</i>.
By this time, however, the remaining copy of <i>Divine Songs
and Meditacions</i> seems to have slipped from sight; scholars were a
long time finding it, but in 1924, the &ldquo;unique&rdquo; copy bearing the autograph
of Thomas Park was removed from the library at Britwell Court
and sold by Sotheby to A. S. W. Rosenbach, who acted in behalf of
Henry E. Huntington, in whose memorial library it now remains. If
a second edition of the work ever existed, as claimed by Allibone,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fd_4">[4]</a>
it has vanished (to my knowledge, without a further trace); for all
practical purposes, Anne Collins and her <i>Divine Songs and Meditacions</i>
are unknown even to scholars of seventeenth-century literature.</p>
<p>Though it appears that the verses of Anne Collins have been
spared extinction, it is problematic whether they will escape obscurity.
Dr. Johnson and Warton did not mention them. Yet knowledgeable,
if lesser, men found the <i>Songs and Meditacions</i> worth
reading. We may infer, for example, that Thomas Park, who was
praised by Southey as the most distinguished authority on Old-English
poetry, admired the <i>Songs</i>, for it seems probable that he
recommended to Brydges the passages finally anthologized in <i>Restituta</i>.
In any case, for their metrical variety, spiritual tone, and
structural quaintness, Brydges found the <i>Songs and Meditacions</i> to
<span class="pb" id="Page_ii">[ii]</span>
be of value. Allibone reprinted Brydges&rsquo; commentary, implying (at
least) that he had no strong quarrel with it; and in our own century,
I. A. Williams, having read the single poem in Dyce, described the
&ldquo;lilt and diction&rdquo; of the language as &ldquo;charming,&rdquo; and called for a
new edition of the work.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fd_5">[5]</a> It may be that a wider knowledge of her
writing would rescue Anne Collins only from oblivion into abuse. But if
that is so, it is only fair to say that she wrote with a full awareness
of her poetic limitations. Referring to herself as &ldquo;unskilfull,&rdquo;
she claimed to have written only to occupy her mind, and
then only that, in her lingering illness, she might not fall victim to
Sloth. Anne Collins may not have been a Puritan,<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fd_6">[6]</a> but her verses
are, in several respects, a form of the diary. To her, questions of
aesthetics, at least as we would normally think of them, were quite
irrelevant. She was convinced that the expression of a dedicated
heart was of greater value than a polished line. Even if that
expression were in the form of somewhat unsteady verses, it would not
be without merit: &ldquo;<i>Yet for theyr matter, I suppose they bee /
Not worthlesse quite, whilst they with Truth agree.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are dependent upon the autobiographical quality of the work for all
we know of its author. She might have been any one of the many Annes
who, during the first half of the seventeenth century, married into
or out of the Collins name (or the name might be a pseudonym). But
especially in the first third of the work, in the prose &ldquo;To the
Reader&rdquo; and the metrical &ldquo;Preface&rdquo; and &ldquo;Discourse,&rdquo;
we recognize the autobiography of a woman who was, from early
childhood, the chronic victim of disease. In &ldquo;The Discourse&rdquo; (omitted
here because of its length and repetitiousness), she describes
the life of one whose hope lay in her adjustment to pain. Drawing
upon the imagery of spiritual autobiography, Anne Collins describes
her youth as a wilderness, her soul as a withered flower. Only when
she takes direction from her sorrow does her soul draw in the rain
of grace. And that regenerating force is the recurrent theme of her
writing, the sole enduring source of peace; the world offered only
the appearance, the &ldquo;counterfet&rdquo; of satisfaction. Thus, as Anne
Collins composes her devotional verses, she is impelled by four
pious reasons. These are indicative, not only of how the author
justifies her writing from a poetic point of view, but of how
completely she has explained away all the claims of a world that had
<span class="pb" id="Page_iii">[iii]</span>
once tortured her with longing. First, all creatures had been ordained
to praise God; this, in her songs and meditations, she attempts to
do. Recognizing that her talents are few, she recalls that even the
man with a single talent would be called to account. Third, she
wishes that some kinsman out of interest in her writing might be
encouraged to read the Scriptures. And last, she thinks of those
who will never meet or know her; by reading the <i>Divine Songs and
Meditacions</i>, they may look upon &ldquo;the image of her mind,&rdquo; and from
that learn how God takes pity on even his most lowly servant.</p>
<p>The selections in this reprint have been made in the hope of
fairly representing Anne Collins to the scholarly reader. Within the
range of possibilities, an attempt was made to preserve the proportions
in the original work among the various kinds of writing attempted by
the author. Perhaps deletion of &ldquo;The Discourse&rdquo; defeated
this purpose. But it was decided also that no individual poem would be
cut. Thus, to have included the 102 stanzas of &ldquo;The Discourse&rdquo;
would have required dropping several more songs and meditations.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fd_7">[7]</a>
The poem on the Civil War, like the paraphrase on the fifth chapter
of Ecclesiastes, was eliminated because its subject matter was not
thought representative of the work as a whole. The notes will direct
the reader to parts of Anne Collins&rsquo; work which may be found
in previous publications.</p>
<p>The Huntington copy of <i>Divine Songs and Meditacions</i> is a
small octavo volume, measuring slightly larger than five by three
inches. The pages have been cropped and the margins have worn
away; thus, in some instances (pp. 50, 56, 68), text has been lost.
The original volume is now sandwiched within protecting leaves of
blank paper, and the entire volume is bound in thick, brown calf.
The title page, once detached, has been backed and cemented to
the second leaf, but this repair was made long before the blank leaves
were inserted. The original volume is made up of 52 leaves; the
first gathering consists of four, the remaining six of eight leaves.
There are 102 pages of text.</p>

<h1><br />To the Reader</h1>
<p><i>Christian Reader</i>,</p>
<p>I inform you, that by divine
Providence, I have been restrained
from bodily employments, suting
with my disposicion, which enforced
me to a retired Course of life; Wherin it
pleased God to give me such inlargednesse
of mind, and activity of spirit, so that this
seeming desolate condicion, proved to me
most delightfull: To be breif, I became
affected to Poetry, insomuch that I proceeded
to practise the same; and though
the helps I had therein were small, yet the
thing it self appeared unto me so amiable,
as that it enflamed my faculties, to put
forth themselvs, in a practise so pleasing.</p>
<p>Now the furtherances I had herein, was
what I could gather (by the benifit of hearing,)
at first from prophane Histories;
which gave not that satisfactory contentment,
before mencioned; but it was the manifestacion
of Divine Truth, or rather the
Truth it self, that reduced my mind to a
peacefull temper, and spirituall calmnesse,
taking up my thoughts for Theologicall
employments.</p>
<p>Witnesse hereof, this Discourse, Songs
and Meditacions following; which I have
set forth (as I trust) for the benifit, and
comfort of others, Cheifly for those
Christians who are of disconsolat Spirits,
who may perceive herein, the Faithfullnesse
Love, &amp; Tender Compassionatnesse
of God to his people, in that according
to his gracious Promise, <i>He doth not leave
nor forsake them. <span class="scripref">Heb. 13.5.</span></i> But causeth
<i>all things to work for theyr good. <span class="scripref">Rom. 8.28.</span></i>
This I doubt not, but most Saints in som
measure, do experimentally know, therefore
I will not seek by argument, to prove
a thing so perspicuous. And now (Courteous

<p class="t0">Being through weakness to the house confin&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">My mentall powers seeming long to sleep,</p>
<p class="t0">were summond up, by want of wakeing mind,</p>
<p class="t0">Their wonted course of exercise to keep,</p>
<p class="t0">And not to waste themselves in slumber deep;</p>
<p class="t0">Though no work can bee so from error kept</p>
<p class="t0">But some against it boldly will except:</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet sith it was my morning exercise</p>
<p class="t0">The fruit of intellectuals to vent,</p>
<p class="t0">In Songs or counterfets of Poesies,</p>
<p class="t0">And haveing therein found no small content,</p>
<p class="t0">To keep that course my thoughts are therfore bent,</p>
<p class="t0">And rather former workes to vindicate</p>
<p class="t0">Than any new conception to relate.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Our glorious God his creatures weaknesse sees,</p>
<p class="t0">And therefore deales with them accordingly,</p>
<p class="t0">Giveing the meanes of knowledg by degrees,</p>
<p class="t0">Vnfoulding more and more the Mystery,</p>
<p class="t0">And opening the Seales successively, <span class="scripref">Rev. 6.</span></p>
<p class="t0">So of his goodnesse gives forth demonstracions,</p>
<p class="t0">To his Elect in divers Dispensacions.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In legall wise hee did himself expresse</p>
<p class="t0">To be the only Lord Omnipotent</p>
<p class="t0">A just avenger of all wickednesse,</p>
<p class="t0">A jelous God in power emminent,</p>
<p class="t0">Which terror workes, and pale astonishment;</p>
<p class="t0">Sith plagues for sin are holden forth thereby,</p>
<p class="t0">But with no strength to crush inniquity.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now with the Law the Gospell oft appeares,</p>
<p class="t0">But under vailes, perspicuous unto few</p>
<p class="t0">Who were as those which of good tydings heares,</p>
<p class="t0">Rejoyceing much at the report or show</p>
<p class="t0">Of that the Saints now by possessing know;</p>
<p class="t0">Oft spake the Prophets Evangelicall,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose words like kindly drops of rain did fall.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But when the plenerie of time was come</p>
<p class="t0">The springs of grace their plesant streams out deald</p>
<p class="t0">Felicitie did evidence on her some</p>
<p class="t0">Salvacion and the way thereto reveald,</p>
<p class="t0">Who wounded were in spirit, might be heald;</p>
<p class="t0">Here God declares the Beauties of his Face,</p>
<p class="t0">Great Love, rich Mercy, free Eternall Grace.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This time was when the Sonne of Righteousnesse</p>
<p class="t0">His Luster in the world began to spread,</p>
<p class="t0">Which more and more to his he doth expresse</p>
<p class="t0">In tearms so large that they that run may read,</p>
<p class="t0">And to himselfe he doth the weaker lead;</p>
<p class="t0">He to his bosum will his Lambs collect,</p>
<p class="t0">And gently those that feeble are direct. <span class="scripref">Isa. 40. 11</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And so in them a life of grace instill</p>
<p class="t0">Whereby they shall be able to obay</p>
<p class="t0">All Gospell precepts suting with his will,</p>
<p class="t0">And that without regard of servill pay,</p>
<p class="t0">But with free hearts, where Christ alone doth sway</p>
<p class="t0">Causing the apprehensions of his love,</p>
<p class="t0">To gender love, which still doth active prove.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Where Christ thus ruleth, I suppose remaines</p>
<p class="t0">No heart that hankers after Novelties</p>
<p class="t0">Whose ground is but the Scum of frothy braines</p>
<p class="t0">Perhaps extracted from old Heresies,</p>
<p class="t0">New formd with Glosses to deceive the eyes</p>
<p class="t0">Of those who like to Children, do incline</p>
<p class="t0">To every new device that seemes to shine.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I am perswaded they that relish right,</p>
<p class="t0">The Dainties of Religion, Food divine,</p>
<p class="t0">Have therby such a permanent delight,</p>
<p class="t0">And of best Treasures, such a lasting mine,</p>
<p class="t0">As that their hearts to change do not incline,</p>
<p class="t0">I therfore think theyr tastes of Truth is ill,</p>
<p class="t0">Who Truths profession, quickly alter will.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I speak not this to manifest despight</p>
<p class="t0">To tru Religions growth or augmentacion,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor do I take offence of greater Light</p>
<p class="t0">Which brings <span class="f">probatum est</span>, or commendacion</p>
<p class="t0">From Truth it selfe, having therto relacion,</p>
<p class="t0">But rather with the Saints I doe rejoyce,</p>
<p class="t0">When God appeares to his in Gospel-voyce.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now touching that I hasten to expresse</p>
<p class="t0">Concerning these, the ofspring of my mind,</p>
<p class="t0">Who though they here appeare in homly dresse</p>
<p class="t0">And as they are my works, I do not find</p>
<p class="t0">But ranked with others, they may go behind,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet for theyr matter, I suppose they bee</p>
<p class="t0">Not worthlesse quite, whilst they with Truth agree.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Indeed I grant that sounder judgments may</p>
<p class="t0">(Directed by a greater Light) declare</p>
<p class="t0">The ground of Truth more in a Gospel-way,</p>
<p class="t0">But who time past with present will compare</p>
<p class="t0">Shall find more mysteries unfolded are,</p>
<p class="t0">So that they may who have right informacion</p>
<p class="t0">More plainly shew the path-way to Salvacion.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet this cannot prevayl to hinder me</p>
<p class="t0">From publishing those Truths I do intend,</p>
<p class="t0">As strong perfumes will not concealed be,</p>
<p class="t0">And who esteemes the favours of a Freind,</p>
<p class="t0">So little, as in silence let them end,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor will I therfore only keep in thought,</p>
<p class="t0">But tell what God still for my Soule hath wrought.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When Clouds of Melancholy over-cast</p>
<p class="t0">My heart, sustaining heavinesse therby,</p>
<p class="t0">But long that sad condicion would not last</p>
<p class="t0">For soon the Spring of Light would blessedly</p>
<p class="t0">Send forth a beam, for helps discovery,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
